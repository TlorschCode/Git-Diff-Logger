# Git-Diff-Logger
A repo to store git diffs I've made so I can log them for a school assignment.


It uses the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 because I don't know what licenses exactly are used in the repos I contributed to, and I'd rather avoid a copyright strike. This one is the strictest on GitHub, apparently.


<p><i><b>Note to self</b></i>: Use <a href="https://pxmyh.github.io/PatchViewer/" target="_blank">Git Patch Viewer</a> to view .diff files as side-by-side files.


I've got nothing else interesting to say.
