# Git-Diff-Logger
A repo to store git diffs I've made so I can log them for a school assignment.


It uses the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 because I don't know what licenses exactly are used in the repos I contributed to, and I'd rather avoid a copyright strike. This one is the strictest on GitHub, apparently.


*Note to self*: Use [Git Patch Viewer]([url](https://pxmyh.github.io/PatchViewer/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) to view .diff files as side-by-side files.


I've got nothing else interesting to say.
